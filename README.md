#  Learn Numbers App

The objective of the app: provide a tool for kids to master their handwriting (numbers 0-9). 

The interaction with the app consists of several steps: 
* Get a task to draw a specific number (voice); 
* Draw a number (on a screen);
* Hear the feedback;
* Get info about previous successful attempts (score);

* User can replay the task by clicking on the Play Button;
* User can clean the drawing pad to start over (Start Over Button);
* User can move to the next task by clicking on the Next Button.

UI is intentionally very mimimalistic so kids will focus on the main objective of the app.  \
(Real testers demostraited that even mimimalistic design hasn't stopped yound minds to use the app for other reasons: it is a great drawing tool as well)))
